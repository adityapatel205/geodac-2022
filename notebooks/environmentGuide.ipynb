    "# Creating our virtual environment\n",
    "\n",
    "We need some specific Python and C++ libraries in order to manipulate the datasets being used in this project. We have found that the easiest way to facilitate a standard environment across platforms is to create a virtual environment with all of the necessary components. It is assumed that you have already installed the [Anaconda distribution of Python](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution). \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be installing the following libraries and their dependencies:\n",
    "\n",
    "* numpy\n",
    "* matplotlib \n",
    "* h5py\n",
    "* netCDF4\n",
    "* Cartopy\n",
    "* pandas\n",
    "* ipykernel\n",
    "* data-downloader\n",
    "\n",
    "First, open up the command prompt where we'll be creating this virtual environment. On Windows, this means opening the Anaconda prompt. On Mac or Linux, you will use your regular command line terminal. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the easiest procedure, download the **environment.yml** file provided on the github. Place the environment.yml file in your current working directory. If you type `dir` on Windows or `ls` on Mac/Linux, you should see this file in the list that prints. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, modify the last line of the **environment.yml** file to point to the directory on your system where the environment will be saved. On Windows, this might look like `prefix: C:\\\\Users\\\\Emily\\\\anaconda3\\\\envs\\\\GEODACenv`. On a Mac, Anaconda is installed in a slightly different place: `prefix: /opt/anaconda3/envs/GEODACenv`.\n",
