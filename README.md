# Welcome to GEOD@C, 2022

Thank you for joining us.

GEOD@C (Generating Earth Observation Datasets At Carleton) establishes a collaborative learning environment for members of the Carleton University community to learn about Earth Observation data and get some experience creating new datasets.

# Where Do I Start?

Good question. We will use Python as a common coding language, and will be building up an environment that contains all of the underlying libraries using Anaconda (www.anaconda.com). Once you have Anaconda installed on your system, your next stop is the environmentGuide notebook.
